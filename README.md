My Blog
======

This blog isn't necessarily for other people to read, but more for me to document my progress. It started out as a project 
to learn Wordpress and how to create a custom theme. For the time being, it's posts by me discussing new tools, languages, and such. 

Slowly it has evolved into an informal blog, which anyone is free to read.
